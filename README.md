**Work in progress**

C# implementation of useful functionalities from the Javascript [D3](d3js.org) library.
My goal is to implement scales, axes and paths generators to be able to produce basic charts in a WPF.

Selection methods, enter-update-exit, etc. won't be made part of this, as these functionalities are pure HTMl DOM manipulation.
